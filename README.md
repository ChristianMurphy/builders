# @pika/pack - Official Build Plugins

This repo contains the official build plugins for @pika/pack.

- **Write your own!** @pika/pack can load local builders by relative path directly from your repo.
- **Publish & Share your own!** These official builders are just the start. Create a PR to add your community plugin to this list.


#### Source Builders:

> **NOTE: Make sure include a source builder early in your pipeline.** Source builders take your modern source code (ESNext, TS, etc.) and compile it to standard, ES2018 JavaScript. Other builders will then use this standardized build to base their own work off of.

 - `@pika/plugin-standard-pkg`: Compiles JavaScript/TypeScript to ES2018. Supports personalized, top-level `.babelrc` plugins/config.
 - `@pika/plugin-ts-standard-pkg`: Compiles TypeScript to ES2018 (Uses `tsc` internally instead of Babel, and builds type definitions automatically).

#### Distribution Builders:

 - `@pika/plugin-build-deno`: Builds a distribution that runs on Deno (TS projects only).
 - `@pika/plugin-build-node`: Builds a distribution that runs on Node LTS (v6+).
 - `@pika/plugin-build-types`: Builds TypeScript definitions from your TS, or automatically generate them from your JS. Not required if you use `@pika/plugin-ts-standard-pkg`.
 - `@pika/plugin-build-web`: Builds an ESM distribution optimized for browsers & bundlers.

#### WASM Builders:
 - `@pika/plugin-wasm-assemblyscript`: Builds WASM from TypeScript using [AssemblyScript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript).
 - `@pika/plugin-wasm-bucklescript`: Builds WASM from ReasonML/OCAML using [BuckleScript](https://bucklescript.github.io/).
 - `@pika/plugin-wasm-bindings`: Builds a simple JS wrapper for any WASM build.

#### Advanced Builders:
 - `@pika/plugin-bundle-node`: Creates a Node.js build with all code (including dependencies) bundled into a single file. Useful for CLIs.
 - `@pika/plugin-bundle-web`: Creates a ESM build with all code (including dependencies) bundled. Useful for unpkg & serving code directly to browsers.
 - `@pika/plugin-simple-bin`:  Generates & configures a CLI wrapper to run your library from the command line.
